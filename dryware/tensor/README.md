Things to do

Modeling CNS networks and afferent input and effernt output.

Interesting cross over with general realtitivy cosmology and possible unified theory to quantum phenomena sub atomic particles particle theory.

<todo: investigate further, looks promissing, >

Executive architecture model? short term?
