# Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks and simulation of biological neural networks.

* Spiking neural network SNN, also Deeplearning, 
* Many overlaps with graphics, for example general programming for GPU's.  
* Many overlaps with ML. But focus on neural nets not numerical and data analysis.

TODO
* <todo: Spiking Neural Network SNN, likely SpiNaker, CSA, PyNN, NEST, >
* <todo: second order importance, NN deeplearning framework choice?, >
