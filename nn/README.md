# Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks and simulation of biological neural networks.

* Spiking neural network SNN, pulse coupled neural network PCNN, higher order network HON, ...
* Many overlaps with graphics, for example general programming for GPU's.  
* Many overlaps with ML. But focus on neural nets not numerical and data analysis.
