NEST (Neural Simulaiton Tool) introduction. Spiking Neural Netowrk SNN simulation.

TODO
* <todo: go through the documentation and implement some of the code examples. >
* <todo: likely PyNN over NEST. >
* <todo: consider also NEST Cpp api. Good excuse for some fun with Cpp code! >

DONE
* <done: n/a>

Version
* NEST v3.7 [GH](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/releases/tag/v3.7), can nest be compiled for windows? requires C++ 17 compiler. 
* NEST docs [WS](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
* NEST MS Win [WS](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/user.html#windows-install) no good install options for windows users.
