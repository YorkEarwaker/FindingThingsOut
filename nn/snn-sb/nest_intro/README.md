# NEST Intro

NEST (Neural Simulaiton Tool) introduction. Spiking Neural Netowrk SNN simulation.

### Status
Have downloaded NEST source code. But don't know if it will compile on MS Windows. There are no other good download options for Windows environments. No Windows binary. Shame. So trying to set up a separate standalone NEST only development environment will be a big time effort. So will likely choose another simulator for intro to PyNN. For ease of use Python pip install option. Which probably means the Neuron simulator. But it will be a start to coding in PyNN. Will try to install NEST into the PyNN dev environment at a later date. What a shame.

try conda python env?
* conda install -c conda-forge nest
* conda install -c conda-forge pynest

TODO
* <todo: contact NEST team, enquire re conda, enquire re compilation on MS Win, >
* <todo: install conda, use conda as NEST python env, try conda install, may fail due to no MS Win binary? worth a try?>
* <todo: go through the documentation and implement some of the code examples. >
* <todo: likely PyNN over NEST. >
* <todo: consider also NEST Cpp api. Good excuse for some fun with Cpp code! >
